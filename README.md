# GUI Automatons

A Graphical User Interface to play (and stop) with different cellular automatons. You can switch between the different automatons, generate random maps, reset them, draw cells on the grid, speed up the turns. Delivered with the Conway's Game of Life and a Wildfire game (firefighters not implemented yet) where fire spreads, on the trees, turning them to ashes (rip forest).

It's made in a clean MVC architecture so implementing new automatons is quite easy. 

### Context

This project was made by Alice DRAILLARD and Hugo FOURNIER for our CPBx computer science project (from February to March 2018) as our first steps in software architectures and GUI with the Tkinter library.
